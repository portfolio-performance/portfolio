        Thanks for reporting this issue!

        **Language:** You can submit PDF import issues in English or German.

        **Debugging Guide:** Follow [this tutorial](https://help.portfolio-performance.info/en/how-to/requesting-new-importer/) to extract text for debugging.

        **Steps:**
        1. Open Portfolio Performance.
        2. Click 'File' --> 'Import' --> 'Debug: Create text from PDF...'.
        3. Select the file you're trying to import.
        4. Use the built-in anonymization feature to remove personal data (e.g., name, address, deposit number).
        5. Do **not** anonymize the bank's address, stock names, or dates. Only anonymize amounts if they remain consistent.
        6. Click "Copy to Clipboard" and paste the anonymized text below.

        **Do NOT upload PDFs to GitHub.** Always use the debug feature instead.

        Clearly describe the problem. Examples:
        - The document cannot be read.
        - Some transactions are missing (which ones?).
        - Transactions have incorrect amounts (what are they vs. what should they be?).
        - Any other issue.
