Immediate sales are assumed for positions currently held.\n\n* The position weight is calculated from the purchase price of the position relative to the total number of all purchase prices.\n\n* Result "average holding period of all positions" is the sum of the products "holding period * percentage position weight" across all positions.

TooltipRebalancingIndicator = Color coding according to the {0}/{1} Rule:\n\n{0}% absolute deviation: {2} is {3} of {4}\n{1}% relative deviation: {2} is {5} of {6}\n\nConfigure in toolbar.

TooltipSemiVolatility = Semivariance only looks at the negative fluctuations of an asset.\n\nIf the negative and postive fluctuations are equal, then the following holds\n\nVolatility (v) = Semi-variance (s) * \u221A2\n\nIf the current data set is evenly distributed, then the semivariance is\n\n  s = v \u00F7 \u221A2 = {2} \u00F7 \u221A2 = {0}\n\nCompare that with the actual semivariance\n\n  {0} {1} {3}\n  evenly distributed {1} actual semivariance\n\n\nThe semivariance is calculated using the "accumulated" data series. Therefore performance-neutral transactions have no impact. Weekends and public holidays are ignored (for example Easter and Christmas days).
