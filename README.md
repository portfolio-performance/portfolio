## Prerequisites

* [Java 8](https://www.java.com)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)
* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org)

## Developing with Eclipse

### Eclipse Setup

To develop, use the latest [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) release plus **Plug-in Development Environment (PDE)**. PDE homepage is https://www.eclipse.org/pde/ and it can be installed via Help/Install new Software. The link for the update site is mentioned in the PDE docs.

Optionally, install via the Eclipse Marketplace
* infinitest
* ResourceBundle Editor
* SonarLint
* Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in

### Setup

Clone the git repository.

Import projects by
* selecting "Import Projects..." on the Git repository in the Git perspective
* choosing "File" > "Import..." > "Existing Projects into Workspace" from the menu

After importing the Portfolio Performance projects in Eclipse, they will not compile due to missing dependencies: the target platform is missing.

### Set Target Platform

* Open the portfolio-target-definition project
* Open the portfolio-target-definition.target file with the Target Editor (this may take a while as it requires Internet access). If you just get an XML file, use right click and chose Open With *Target Editor*
* In the resulting editor, click on the "Set as Active Target Platform" link at the top right (this may also take a while)

### Run Program

Run the application and the tests with the launch configurations stored in ~/portfolio-app/eclipse folder (right-click "Run As").

:warning: The launch configuration needs an update when bundles are added and removed or the OS platform changes. If the program does not start, try selecting "Add required plug-ins" in the launch configuration dialog.


## Building with Maven

Maven is not required (anymore) to develop Portfolio Performance as you can develop using the Eclipse IDE with the setup above. The Maven build is used for the [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/buchen/portfolio) build.

### Configure

*Mac OS X / Linux*
```
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1g"
```

*Windows*
```
set MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1g"
```

### Build

Run Maven 3.x.x in the 'portfolio-app' directory:

```
mvn clean verify -Dtycho.disableP2Mirrors
```
