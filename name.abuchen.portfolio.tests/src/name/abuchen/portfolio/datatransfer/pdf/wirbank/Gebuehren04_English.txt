Calculation: The effective VIAC administration fee is derived from the average pension assets less cash balance and taking into 
account the fee cap of 0.40%. Any allowances are then additionally deducted from this amount. Basis for the calculation is the VIAC 
administration fee of 0.52% p.a., which is charged on a maximum of 76.92% of invested assets. Investments above this level are 
managed free of charge thanks to the fee cap.
Note: Whenever possible, our foundation bears the product costs (index funds). In the case of ETFs, product costs are charged 
within the fund and accrue in favor of the fund provider. Product costs accrue in addition to the administration fee and amount to 
0.00 % per year for the currently selected strategy. VIAC does not receive any kind of reimbursements (retrocessions).
