Advice (ERA) in respect to these Excluded Investment Products is exempted from the application of section 27 FAA. This exemption indicates TBSPL is not obliged to ensure any recommendation or advice in relation to such excluded 
investment products are suitable for you to invest or transact. As a general summary, this list includes all listed securities approved for listing on a securities exchange available to the public to trade in. As such, under the law TBSPL 
assume that you are able to and will make your own decisions on whether any excluded investment product is or is not suitable for you , as well as whether ERA in respect of an excluded investment product is or is not suitable to 
you. You are therefore hereby notified:
①Any and every ERA that you may receive with respect to any listed excluded investment product does not consider your investment objectives, financial situation and particular needs; and
②It is your sole responsibility to ensure the suitability of the product recommended to you. Despite the foregoing, Regulation 33A of the Financial Advisers Regulations require the provision of any ERA with respect to any listed 
excluded investment product must be accompanied by the rationale for trading in such product. You should therefore take specific note (you should ask for it if it is not provided) of the rationale that the relevant representatives
