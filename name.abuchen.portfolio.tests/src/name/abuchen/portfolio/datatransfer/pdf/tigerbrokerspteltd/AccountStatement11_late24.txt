Notes: Accrued Dividends refers to the expected amount of cash or number of shares you will receive after a company announces a dividend. Before the payment is made, the amount or shares will appear as “accrued.” Once the 
dividend is officially distributed, the cash will be credited to your account balance, or the shares will be added to your holdings.
