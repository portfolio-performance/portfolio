The securities in your account are held in the name of Canadian ShareOwner Investments Inc., the custodian. Because the custodian is a member of the Canadian Investor Protection Fund,
the securities in your account are covered by that fund. The money-weighted returns table shows the total percentage return of your account for the period(s) ending December 31, 2020. Your
total percentage return means the cumulative realized and unrealized capital gains and losses of an investment, plus income from the investment, over a specified period of time, expressed as a
percentage. Returns are calculated after costs have been deducted, including transaction charges and account-related fees, but not income tax.
