Apex’s policy is to pay all dividends and interest in US Dollars. Apex will allow the following countries to be paid in their foreign currency (Canadian Dollars, British Pounds, Euros, Argentine 
Peso, Chinese Renminbi, Korean Won, Philippine Peso and Brazilian Real).
Participation in Fully Paid Lending Program 
Customers participating in the Fully-Paid Securities Lending Program should be aware that shares on loan are not covered by FDIC or SIPC. Cash securities collateralizing shares are held at JP 
Morgan Chase & Co. and not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections. Please consult the Master Securities Lending Agreement for additional information.           
Information Regarding Cost Basis for Foreign Account Statements
Foreign Currency: Cost basis is required to be reported in U.S. dollars for tax purposes. It is the responsibility of the account holder to convert sales proceeds paid in foreign currency to U.S. 
dollars to avoid inaccurate cost basis calculations. When reporting the purchase or sale, you must determine the U.S. dollar amounts to be reported as of the settlement date, at the spot rate 
or by following a reasonable spot rate convention. See Regulations section 1.6045-1(d)(8).    
                                                                                                                                         
Payment of Interest to holders of Municipal Securities - you may be subject to a substitute interest payment if the transfer of ownership of your municipal security has not been 
completed prior to the next interest payment. Please contact a tax professional for more specific details.
IMPORTANT INFORMATIO N
To our valued customers:
FINRA Rule 2231 requires that we advise you to promptly report any inaccuracy or discrepancy in your account (within 10 days after available) to your brokerage firm and clearing firm (where 
these are different firms) and to re-confirm any oral communications in writing.
https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/06-72                                                                                                                                                             
"IMPORTANT - Part of your distribution includes a return of capital. Any distribution that represents a return of capital reduces the estimated per share value shown on your account 
statement."
The preceding notice is required when reporting distributions on Direct Participation Programs and/or REITs and is subject to the DPP or REIT sponsor’s final capital return determination as 
detailed in the IRS Form 1099 or K-1, as applicable.
Alternative or Other Investments, DPP, and Unlisted securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, are generally illiquid and that, even if a customer is able to sell the securities, 
the price received may be less than the per share estimated value provided in the account. The evaluation method used for any particular DPP or REIT will be provided to clients upon request. 
Certain positions are not held on Apex’s books or custodied by Apex and are not Protected by SIPC.

Pursuant to SEC Rule 606, Apex Clearing Corporation is required to make publicly available a quarterly report with regard to its routing of non-directed orders. For the purpose of this Rule, we

be accessed on the internet at: http://public.s3.com/rule606/apex/, or a written copy will be furnished at no cost upon request via telephone to (214) 765-1009.  
SEC Rule 606 (b) requires a broker-dealer to disclose to its customers, upon request, "the identity of the venue to which the customer’s orders were routed for execution in the six months prior 
to the request, whether the orders were directed orders or non-directed orders, and the time of the transactions, if any, that resulted from such orders."
In accordance with the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008  broker-dealers are required to track and report cost basis to the IRS in three phases over the next three years.
 jEquity securities acquired on or after January 1, 2011
 jMutual fund and dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012:  
 jDebit securities, options, and all other financial instruments acquired on or after January 1, 2014. (The IRS has extended this date from the previously announced date of January 1, 2013.)
Beginning this upcoming tax reporting season the cost basis of any covered equity security transaction (purchased after 12/31/10) that is required to be reported on a 1099-B will include its 
associated cost basis. If you have any questions about this important change to the IRS mandated reporting requirements, please contact your broker-dealer or registered advisor.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONTINUED
Please take note of the following description of Apex Clearing Corporation’s excess SIPC coverage, which reflects certain changes made to the coverage effective August 8, 2013.  The 
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (×SIPCÖ) protects certain customer funds up to a ceiling of $500,000, including a maximum of $250,000 for cash claims. Please note SIPC does 
not cover commodity contracts and options on futures.  For additional information regarding SIPC coverage, including a brochure, please contact SIPC at (202) 371-8300 or visit 
www.sipc.org.
Apex has purchased an additional insurance policy to supplement SIPC protection.  This additional insurance policy, widely known as ×excess SIPC,Ö becomes available to customers in the 
event that SIPC limits are exhausted.  This additional insurance provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate limit of $150 million, subject to sub-limits for any one 
customer of $37.5 million for securities and $900,000 for cash.  Similar to SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.  For 
additional information, please contact your broker. 
FDIC SWEEP PROGRAM
For customers with balances in a bank deposit account as part of the Apex FDIC-Insured Sweep Program or shares of a money market mutual fund in which you have a beneficial interest, 
those balances or shares may be liquidated on your order and the proceeds returned to your account or remitted to you in accordance with the applicable prospectus and/or Terms and 
Conditions of the program.
For customers participating in the Apex FDIC-Insured Sweep Program, the Apex FDIC-Insured Sweep Program allows your cash balance to be eligible for insurance protection through the FDIC 
up to the maximum applicable insurance limits. Customers may obtain information about FDIC, by contacting the FDIC at 1-877-275-3342, 1-800-925-4618 (TDD) or by visiting www.fdic.gov. 
Deposit Account balances in the Apex FDIC-Insured Sweep Program are not protected by SIPC or any other excess coverage by Apex Clearing Corporation. Deposit Account balances are 
protected as established by current applicable laws regulated by the FDIC.
NOTE: Occasionally, Apex FDIC-Insured Sweep Program’s banks ("Program Banks") may be added or removed from the Participating Bank List, which is available on Apex’s website. Apex will, 
to the extent possible, update the Participating Bank List, with any added Program Banks at least 30 calendar days before making deposits. If a Program Bank is removed from Apex 
FDIC-Insured Sweep Program (the "Program"), it will no longer be able to receive sweeps of your excess cash balance. If any of your excess cash balance is at a Program Bank that is removed

from the Program, Apex will transfer those funds into another Program Bank still in the Program or into your Apex Account, at Apex’s discretion. You may contact your broker to specify any 
Program Banks into which you do not wish your excess cash balance to be swept. Please note that if there are insufficient Program Banks available in the Program, taking into account any 
from which you have opted out, such that not all of your excess cash balance can be spread among Program Banks to ensure FDIC coverage, then some or all of your excess cash balance may 
remain dormant in your Apex Account or may be deposited at a Program Bank but not covered by FDIC insurance. You may obtain additional information on each Program Bank at 
www.fdic.gov.
You are solely responsible for monitoring the total amount of your assets on deposit with each Program Bank (including non-Program funds and accounts) in order to determine the extent of 
FDIC insurance coverage available to you on those deposits, including Program deposits. Apex shall not take into account any money you have on deposit at a Program Bank outside of the
